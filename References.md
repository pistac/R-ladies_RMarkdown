# Introduction

Citations go inside square brackets and are separated by semicolons. Each citation must have a key, composed of ‘@’ + the citation identifier from the database. For example, we have published a paper together [@Torre2016]. In another paper, which we cite in text, without parentheses, @Navon1977 talks about visual perception; and in another paper, for which we don't want to repeat the name of the author, he talks about psychology again [-@Navon1984].
